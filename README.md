<h1>
  Hello, my name is Adam. 👋 <br>
  I am a game developer and software engineer <br>
  inspired by a passion for art, design, and engineering.
</h1>

<h2>
  I founded the indie game development studio <a href="https://github.com/zigurous">Zigurous</a>.<br>
  We are building a suite of game assets and tutorials<br>
  to help developers grow their skills and make games easier.
</h2>

<h2>
  My specialty is creating flexible and customizable<br>
  systems, tools, and assets, but I also love exploring<br>
  procedurally generated creative works.
